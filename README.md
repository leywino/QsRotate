## ⚡ About QsRotate

**QsRotate** is a minimal Android app that adds a Quick Settings tile for controlling screen rotation. No need to dig through system settings — just swipe down and tap!

> ❓ **Why this app?**  
> Auto-rotate wasn’t working reliably in my tablet's launcher (Nova), especially while switching between portrait (for reading manga/books) and landscape (for watching anime/videos). So I built QsRotate to fix that in the cleanest way possible.

Designed for simplicity and speed, QsRotate requires only the **Modify system settings** permission.
